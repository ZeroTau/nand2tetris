===========

[Nand2Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) took me from "programming's kind of neat I guess" to "holy shit I found my calling".  I can't recommend it highly enough.  Projects 1-6 are available on the site along with all the tests & simulation software.  Go do it.  Why are you still reading this?  Go do it now.

These were among my first non-hello world programs, and I apologize for nothing.
